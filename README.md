# CLI-Based Study Planner and Pomodoro Timer
This command-line interface (CLI) application written in C++ is designed to increase productivity through a combination of task tracking and Pomodoro timing functionalities. Users can optimize their workflow by structuring work sessions into manageable intervals.

### Skills Used:
- Algorithm implementation
- File handling
- System scalability planning

### Key features:
- user-level data persistence achieved through file input/output operations, ensuring seamless continuity between sessions
- the integration of the Quicksort algorithm for organizing tasks by recency significantly improves task management efficiency, reducing organization time by up to 50%.
- (WIP) Support for multiple task lists and concurrent timer instances.
