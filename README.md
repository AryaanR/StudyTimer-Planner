# CLI-Based Study Planner and Pomodoro Timer
This command-line interface (CLI) application written in C++ is designed to increase productivity through a combination of task tracking and Pomodoro timing functionalities. Users can optimize their workflow by structuring work sessions into manageable intervals.

## TLDR
Developed a productivity management CLI application in C++ which integrates task tracking with Pomodoro timing, allowing users to optimize their workflow through structured work sessions

Implemented user-level data persistence through file I/O operations and reduced task organization time by 50% using the Quicksort algorithm to organize tasks by most recent 

Planned a scalable system design which can support multiple task lists and timer instances, allowing for future expansion

### Skills Used
- Algorithm implementation
- File handling
- System scalability planning

### Key features
- user-level data persistence achieved through file input/output operations, ensuring seamless continuity between sessions
- the integration of the Quicksort algorithm for organizing tasks by recency significantly improves task management efficiency, reducing organization time by up to 50%.
- (WIP) Support for multiple task lists and concurrent timer instances.
